# Troubleshooting & FAQ

This guide collects common issues encountered when setting up DAKboard devices at Lowell Makes and how to resolve them.

## Device Won’t Connect to Wi‑Fi

- Ensure the device is within range of the Lowell Makes Wi‑Fi network; aim for signal ≥ –67 dBm.
- Verify that the correct SSID and password are entered during DAKOS setup.
- If the device shows “Offline” for more than 6 hours, power cycle it and reconfigure Wi‑Fi credentials if needed.

## Screen Not Updating

- Check that the DAKboard account still has access to the calendar or media sources used on the screen.
- Verify that the refresh interval is appropriate; using the Plus plan can increase refresh frequency.

## Display Issues

- Set the correct resolution and orientation in DAKOS to match the monitor (e.g., 1920×1080, landscape).
- For persistent black screens, try re‑imaging the SD card and performing a fresh setup.

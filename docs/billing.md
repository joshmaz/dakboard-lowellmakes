# Billing Notes

Information on current subscription plan, billing details, and cost optimization strategies.

- Current plan: Essentials (monthly). Track device count vs. screen addâ€‘ons.
- If using loops/scheduling heavily, evaluate Plus.
- Prefer annual billing if device count stable (cost savings).
- Keep invoices and renewal dates accessible (e.g., via your billing system or separate shared drive) and note renewal dates here.

_TODO: Track plan changes, annual billing savings, and device count._

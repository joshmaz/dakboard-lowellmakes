# Billing Notes

Information on current subscription plan, billing details, and cost optimization strategies.

- Current plan: Essentials (monthly). Track device count vs. screen add-ons.
- If using loops/scheduling heavily, evaluate Plus.
- Prefer annual billing if device count stable (cost savings).
- Keep invoices in `/resources/` and note renewal dates here.

_TODO: Track plan changes, annual billing savings, and device count._

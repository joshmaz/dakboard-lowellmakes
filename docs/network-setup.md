# Network Setup

- Aim for Wi-Fi signal ≥ -67 dBm; otherwise use Ethernet or relocate AP
- If device shows “Offline” > 6 hrs, power cycle and verify Wi-Fi creds
- Consider PoE + Pi for stable installs; label switch ports and VLANs

_TODO: Document IP reservations, kiosk browser setup, and firewall considerations._

# Screen Design Guidelines

Tips and best practices for creating custom DAKboard screens at Lowell Makes.

# Screen Design

## Layout patterns
- Hero (top) + Agenda (right) + Announcements (bottom)
- “Up Next” big block + rotating shop highlights
- Video panel (muted loop) + calendar + QR links

## Readability
- Min font sizes: 36–48pt for headlines, 24–28pt for body at 8–10 ft viewing
- High contrast, avoid dense text; prefer bullets & icons

## Reusable blocks
- Shop logo (top-left), date/time (top-right)
- Agenda calendar (week view)
- Rotating image/video block for projects

## Export/Share
- Export screen JSON; place in `/docs/templates/` with a short README

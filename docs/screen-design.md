# Screen Design Guidelines

Tips and best practices for creating custom DAKboard screens at Lowell Makes.

## Layout patterns

- Hero (top) + Agenda (right) + Announcements (bottom)
- “Up Next” big block + rotating shop highlights
- Video panel (muted loop) + calendar + QR links

## Readability

- Minimum font sizes: 36–48 pt for headlines, 24–28 pt for body copy viewed from 8–10 ft.
- High contrast; avoid dense text; prefer bullets & icons.
- Use Lowell Makes color palette and fonts for consistency.

## Reusable blocks

- Shop logo (top‑left), date/time (top‑right)
- Agenda calendar (week view)
- Rotating image/video block for projects

## Export & Share

- Once you design a screen in the DAKboard editor, **export the screen definition (JSON)**.
- Place exported files in `docs/templates/` and include a short `README.md` describing what the template does and any required data sources.
- Reference these templates in your Pull Request so others can reuse them.

TODO: Add branding guidelines, recommended layouts, and content sources.

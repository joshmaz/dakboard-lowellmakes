# Flows & Scheduling

Guide for setting up screen loops (flows) and scheduling for events and announcements.

## Loops (Plus)

- Combine multiple screens into a loop
- Suggested loop order: Welcome → Agenda → Projects → Events → Sponsors

## Block Scheduling

- Use time-based visibility for Open House nights and special events
- Keep default “evergreen” content for off-hours

## Cadence

- Daily refresh for agendas
- Weekly update for project highlights
- Monthly refresh for sponsor/partner slides

_TODO: Add examples for Open House nights, recurring classes, and special events._

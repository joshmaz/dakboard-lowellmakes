# DAKboard Project for Lowell Makes

Lowell Makes has been using **DAKboard** for a number of years. Our utilization has fluctuated, and presently we are at a minimal implementation. I am offering to step up and volunteer to drive this project in a way that brings value to the Lowell Makes community.

---

## Current Status

- **Subscription**: Essentials Plan  
- **Devices**: 5 total (billed monthly at $21)  
- **Billing**: Monthly (potential savings if switched to annual billing)

---

## Opportunities for Improvement

We are very interested in using features available only in the **Plus Plan**, which comes at a small step up in cost. These features could allow us to greatly improve the experience for members.

### Key Plus Plan Benefits:
- **Screen Loops (Flows):** String multiple screens together on a display for more informative and engaging layouts.
- **Screen Scheduling:** Automate display changes for special events, open houses, and recurring events.
- **Unlimited Calendars** and faster refresh rates.

---

## Example Use Cases

- Schedule **Open House nights** or **special events** directly on displays.  
- Rotate between **multiple screens** on a single device (e.g., shop updates, calendar, weather, and announcements).  
- Improve relevance and engagement by tailoring displays to what’s happening in the makerspace.

## Pricing Ramp (Essentials vs Plus)

| Screens | Essentials Plan | Plus Plan |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| 3       | $11             | **$10** ✅ |
| 4       | $16             | $16       |
| 5       | **$21** ✅       | $22       |

*Note: Essentials cheaper at 5 screens, Plus cheaper at 3. Tie at 4.*

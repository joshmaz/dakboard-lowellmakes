DAKboard Project for Lowell Makes

Lowell Makes has been using DAKboard for a number of years. Our utilization has fluctuated, and presently we are at a minimal implementation. I am offering to step up and volunteer to drive this project in a way that brings value to the Lowell Makes community. 

Presently we have a minimal subscription for a total of five devices billed monthly. We have been paying monthly for a number of years, and could probably save money by switching to annual billing.

We are very interested in using a number of the features available only in the Plus plan, available for a small step up in service costs. The ability to introduce flows, multiple screens strung together, would allow us to greatly improve the experience for all of our members. Also the ability to use scheduling, for special events, recurring events, really making the displays more pertinent to what is happening in the space.

Some examples of ways we can use additional features: 

* Scheduling for Open House nights, special events  
* String multiple screens together on a display to be more informative and engaging
